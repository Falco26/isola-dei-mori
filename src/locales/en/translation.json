  "home-1": "The residential complex of Isola dei Mori is located in Calasapone, on the western coast of the Island of Sant’Antioco. Immersed in the typical scents of the Mediterranean maquis and surrounded by a pleasant silence and the musicality of the sea's movements, you can admire wonderful sunsets.",
  "home-2": "The complex offers a full view of the marvelous sea of Calasapone. It has been created from a large villa surrounded by a garden and divided into seven independent housing units, which are only one kilometer away from the beautiful beach of Calasapone and its cliffs. Additionally, it is just a few minutes by car from the picturesque coves of Cala Lunga, Cala della Signora, Co’ de Quaddus, and Maladroxia, as well as the town of Sant’Antioco."
